TimerTrigger S-BERT Field Classification

User

I have created an azure timertrigger fucntion which fetches column name from SQL db and from column name makes training data. This data is being used to train a ml model from s-bert which classify fields into sources it may come from. Then send it to azure blob to save this. Using this model in azure http trigger we get input from user and predict it's source. Write functional and technical overview based on the description provided

Title: Azure TimerTrigger Function for Training and Predicting Field Sources using S-BERT

Functional Overview:

The Azure TimerTrigger function is designed to automate the process of training and predicting field sources using the S-BERT (Sentence-BERT) model. It performs the following tasks:

Triggering and Fetching Data: The TimerTrigger function is scheduled to run at specified intervals. Upon triggering, it connects to the SQL database and retrieves the column names from the specified table. These column names serve as the basis for generating training data.

Training Data Generation: Using the fetched column names, the function generates training data by constructing sentences that represent the column names and their corresponding sources. For example, if a column name is "Product Description," a training example could be "The field 'Product Description' may come from the 'Product Catalog' source."

S-BERT Model Training: The generated training data is then used to train the S-BERT model. S-BERT is a state-of-the-art pre-trained language model specifically designed for semantic sentence embeddings. It learns to encode sentences into fixed-length vectors that capture their semantic meanings.

Field Source Classification: Once the S-BERT model is trained, the TimerTrigger function can accept input from users via an Azure HTTP Trigger. When a user submits a field name, the function utilizes the trained model to predict the most likely source(s) for that field. For example, given the input "Product Description," the model might predict that it is most likely to come from the "Product Catalog" source.

Blob Storage: The predictions made by the S-BERT model are stored in an Azure Blob Storage container. Each prediction is saved as a separate file or appended to an existing file, depending on the storage strategy chosen. This allows for easy retrieval and analysis of the predictions.

Technical Overview:

The Azure TimerTrigger function is implemented using Azure Functions, a serverless compute service that enables event-driven execution of code. The following components and technologies are involved:

TimerTrigger: Azure Functions provides the TimerTrigger binding, which allows the function to be triggered at specified intervals.

Azure SQL Database: The function connects to an Azure SQL Database to fetch the column names from the specified table. This requires appropriate connection strings and access permissions.

S-BERT Model: The S-BERT model is a machine learning model specifically trained for semantic sentence embeddings. It is implemented using a suitable deep learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch) and trained using the generated training data.

Azure Blob Storage: The Azure Blob Storage service is used to store the predictions made by the S-BERT model. The function uses the appropriate Blob Storage bindings to write the predictions to a designated container in the storage account.

Azure HTTP Trigger: Another Azure Function with an HTTP Trigger is implemented to handle user input. When a user submits a field name, this function invokes the trained S-BERT model and returns the predicted source(s) for that field.

Deployment and Scaling: The Azure Functions and associated resources are deployed to an Azure subscription, utilizing the appropriate deployment tools (e.g., Azure Portal, Azure CLI). The scaling of the TimerTrigger and HTTP Trigger functions can be configured based on expected workload and performance requirements.

The combination of Azure TimerTrigger, Azure SQL Database, S-BERT model, and Azure Blob Storage provides an automated and scalable solution for training and predicting field sources. It enables efficient source classification and storage of predictions for future analysis and decision-making.


Field Source Classification

User

Create a machine learning model which classify fields into source. Fields means columns of data we get from different source. We combine fields and trying to predict the source it may come from.What could be goal and scope of that prototype.


Goal: The goal of the machine learning model is to accurately classify fields into their respective sources based on the data provided.

Scope: The scope of the prototype includes the following aspects:

Data Collection: Gather a diverse and representative dataset containing fields from different sources. This dataset should include a variety of fields and corresponding sources, ensuring that it covers a broad range of scenarios.

Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset to remove any irrelevant or redundant information, handle missing values, and normalize the data if necessary. This step is essential to ensure the quality and consistency of the input data.

Feature Extraction: Extract meaningful features from the fields that capture important characteristics specific to each source. Depending on the nature of the fields, this may involve techniques such as text tokenization, numerical normalization, or categorical encoding.

Model Selection: Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm that suits the classification task. Popular options include decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, or deep learning models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs).

Model Training: Split the preprocessed dataset into training and testing sets. Use the training set to train the selected machine learning model on the extracted features. During training, the model will learn the patterns and relationships between the fields and their respective sources.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model using the testing set to measure its performance and accuracy. This evaluation should consider metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to assess the model's ability to correctly classify the fields into their respective sources.

Model Deployment: Once the model has achieved satisfactory performance, it can be deployed into a production environment where it can be utilized to classify fields into their corresponding sources. This deployment may involve integrating the model into an application or system that requires source classification.

Continuous Improvement: Monitor the performance of the deployed model and collect feedback to identify areas for improvement. Continuously update and retrain the model as new data becomes available to ensure its accuracy and effectiveness over time.

By following these steps, the prototype aims to create a machine learning model that can effectively classify fields into their respective sources, providing insights and automation in the data processing pipeline.
